                         <p>Joined forces with the marketing team to add a touch of UX for the conference website redesign. Last year, we held our very first conference and schedules changed last minute. Since the website wasn't updated and the print materials displayed outdated information, it left many attendees confused and frustrated. Based on feedback from attendees and team members, I created this mobile-first schedule page which syncs with users calendar and allows them to bookmark and get notified about specific events.

                          <p>This product had a lot of complexity and ambiguity; the best strategy was to move quickly and embrace change. It was important to know when to use the right tool, deliver the right fidelity and level of documentation. </p>
                          <h4>Context</h4>
                          <p>In the last quarter of 2016, we began building our enterprise-ready data science platform. This product focused mainly on our data-scientist persona. The core team consisted of the product manager, one developer and me. Some of the basic architecture had been built. Together, we scoped out the features and wrote user stories. I also drafted the first official design process for the product team.</p> 
                          <h4>Constraints</h4> 
                          <p>I was a “UX team of one” so, I had limited time & resources. We experienced frequent changes in direction, deadlines and teams. Based on certain clients, the UI had strict accessibility guidelines. Due to the confidentiality of our clients and data, we relied on input from internal data scientists and client-facing sales engineers. We also experienced a set of development challenges due to the underlying architecture of the platform. </p>

                            <h4>Process</h4>
                            <p>I researched, conducted interviews and competitive analysis to gather as much insight about the product and data science workflows. I explored vastly differently directions collaboratively, by conducting design studios with various colleagues. I received feedback on wireframes from the team and created clickable prototypes to run usability tests with more people. Based on the feedback, I explored some architecture and layout iterations.</p>
                            <p>Around this time, the product direction and deadline shifted, and our team grew. Since we had more developers building components, we needed a set of UI standards. We implemented the existing marketing brand guide, but it lacked many product components and didn’t meet our accessibility requirements. So, I designed a formal product UI kit. Shortly after implementation, the innovator program launched (a month earlier than we anticipated). </p>
                            <p>[insert image of UI kit design direction - text: ][insert image of blockframe - text: Using blockframes to quickly test color schemes.][insert image of wireframe/iteration - text: ][insert image of paper prototype - text: ]</p>
                            <p>At this stage, the company restructured, which affected the product direction once again. Our team changed again and also, a lead designer joined the product team! This new addition brought upon some major changes to the product UI and design process. With the addition of developers to the project, designs were built faster, which required more documentation and communication. So, we created functional specifications to ensure that designs were implemented accurately. In the next couple of months, we launched GA.</p>
                            <p>[insert image of paper prototype - text: ] Launch is never the end. After the launch, we revisited old designs and explored new features and components. In order to get as much feedback as possible, we had lots of meetings, interviews and usability tests with various stakeholders. I organized much of this feedback into categories that and iterated designs to explore solutions. We also researched feedback loops which would allow us to interact directly with select participants. From here, we worked on a new visual direction and forward-looking features. </p>
                            <h4>Lessons Learned (tl;dr)</h4>
                            <p>Lean UX activities like design studios and a design book club helped create a favorable design culture. Less is more except for when it comes to communication. More documentation and presentations meant that teams had more visibility and accountability. </p>

                          <h4>Context</h4>
                          <p>Andrew Harper is a luxury travel publication and full-service travel agency. I was a part of a small web team, and together, we were growing the company's web presence. We had recently updated the visual design of our site and migrated from Drupal to a Django based CMS. Now, It was time to tackle the oldest code in our system: the auctions. The auctions platform was where members could bid on amazing last-minute travel deals. [Photo of the old platform]</p> 
                          <h4>Problem</h4> 
                          <p>A large selection of auction packages went live every week but we had very low participation and engagement. Without a way to filter, browsing packages was difficult. The layout for the overview and details pages were cluttered and lacked visual emphasis on the important data. After my stakeholder meetings, I gained a clear understanding of the elements, requirements, and pain points based on client feedback.</p>
                          <h4>Goals</h4>
                          <p>My goal was to create an engaging auction platform  which effectively displayed all the information necessary for our customers to make informed decisions, while aligning with the company's new overall design direction.</p>

                            <h4>Process</h4>
                            <p>I started with a content audit, heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis. I knew that I wanted to incorporate fun interactivity to my designs (i.e. countdown and live bidding information) to encourage participation. </p>
                            <p>In June 2015, we kicked off our two week design sprint.  I organized the content in a way that groups similar items together, helping to move the eye throughout the page. I started to get feedback on wireframes. After several iterations and meetings, I created clickable prototypes and mockups. After the mockups were approved, we took a 6 month break from this project! In the meantime, I designed additional pages; Based on user testing, I created a new onboarding sequence to explain how this new feature works. In addition, I created auth/unauth views, emails and graphics for auctions related marketing campaigns. 
</p>
                            <h4>Insight & Decisions</h4>
                            <p>In December, I worked closely with development on the prototype and we reviewed it as a team. I recruited 7 users from varying backgrounds to evaluate the usability of the entire process: unauth, onboarding, bidding, and so on. After conducting usability tests, we determined made some revisions to the designs. Based on feedback, we reworked the "bidding bar" to keep all bidding and interactions in a consolidated area. In addition, removed some duplicate components. </p>
                            <p>Due to our new time constraint, we removed filtering from the initial launch. </p>
                            <p>After vigorous testing, the project went live on January. The new system required users to create auction profiles to participate, utilized web sockets for live bidding, featured interactive  max-bid/auto-bid, and a special option to 'buy now' for premium members.</p>
                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p>The new design helped showcase the auction packages, organized the content in a scannable layout. After the redesign, we saw a significant increase in customer interaction, weekly participation and sales of the packages. In addition, we received feedback from happy customers praising the new design.</p>
