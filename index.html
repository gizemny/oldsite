                           <p>Last year, we held our very first conference and learned many lessons. One of the things we wanted to address this year was the last minute schedule changes. Since the website isn't live updated and the print materials displayed outdated information, it left many attendees confused and frustrated. Based on feedback from attendees and team members, I created this mobile-first schedule page which syncs with users calendar and allows them to bookmark and get notified about specific events.

                           <p>I was the lead designer for the auctions redesign. Auctions platform was the oldest code in our system. The look and feel of the existing pages were extremely outdated. The redesign project resulted in increased customer interaction, weekly participation and sales, as well as an intense sense of satisfaction in the faces and hearts of everyone who viewed it. </p>

                          <p>Last quarter of 2016, we began building our enterprise-ready data science platform. Initially, the core team was limited to a handful of people. This product had a lot of complexity and ambiguity; the best strategy was to move quickly and embrace change. It was important to know when to use the right tool, deliver the right fidelity and level of documentation. We began by scoping out the features and writing user stories. I also drafted the first official design process for the product team.</p> 
                          <h4>Constraints</h4> 
                          <p>We experienced frequent changes in product direction, deadlines and teams. Based on certain clients, the UI had strict accessibility guidelines. Due to the confidentiality of our clients and data, we relied on input from internal data scientists and client-facing sales engineers. We experienced a set of development challenges due to the underlying architecture of the platform. As a “UX team of one”, I had limited resources.</p>

                          <p>I researched, conducted interviews and competitive analysis to gather as much insight about the product and data science workflows. I explored vastly differently directions collaboratively, by conducting design studios with various colleagues. I received feedback on wireframes from the team and created clickable prototypes to run usability tests with more people. Based on the feedback, I explored some architecture and layout iterations.</p>

                          <p>Around this time, the product direction and deadline shifted, and our team grew. Since we had more developers building components, we needed a set of UI standards. We implemented the existing marketing brand guide, but it lacked many product components and didn’t meet our accessibility requirements. So, I designed a formal product UI kit. Shortly after implementation, the innovator program launched - a month earlier than we anticipated. </p>

                          <p>At this stage, the company restructured, which affected the product direction once again. Our team changed again and also, a lead designer joined the product team! This new addition brought upon some major changes to the product UI and design process. With the addition of developers to the project, designs were built faster, which required more documentation and communication. So, we created functional specifications to ensure that designs were implemented accurately. In the next couple of months, we launched GA.</p>

                          <p>Launch is never the end. After the launch, we revisited old designs and explored new features and components. In order to get as much feedback as possible, we had lots of meetings, interviews and usability tests with various stakeholders. I organized much of this feedback into categories that and iterated designs to explore solutions. We also researched feedback loops which would allow us to interact directly with select participants. From here, we worked on a new visual direction and forward-looking features.</p>
                          <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                          <p>In the beginning of the project, collaborating on design with a mostly remote dev team was challenging. Starting a book club, and implementing Lean UX activities like design studios helped create a favorable design culture. Less is more except for when it comes to communication; More documentation and presentations meant that teams had more visibility and accountability. On the other hand, removing a lot of our collaborative products and switching to Adobe XD & Creative Cloud made asset maintenance more efficient.</p>

                            <p>Andrew Harper is a luxury travel publication and full-service travel agency. I was a part of a small web team, and together, we were growing the company's web presence. We had recently updated the visual design of our site and migrated from Drupal to a Django based CMS. Now, It was time to tackle the oldest code in our system: the auctions. The auctions platform was where members could bid on amazing last-minute travel deals.</p>

                            <p>A large selection of auction packages went live every week but we had very low participation and engagement. After my stakeholder meetings, I gained a clear understanding of the elements, requirements, and pain points based on client feedback.</p>
                            <h4>Goals</h4>
                            <p>My goal was to create an engaging auction platform  which effectively displayed all the information necessary for our customers to make informed decisions, while aligning the platform with the company's new design direction.</p>

                            <h4>Process</h4>
                            <p>I started with a content audit, heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis. I was given a long list of needs and wants. I reached out to people who knew our clients best: the travel agents and sales reps. With their feedback, I knew that I wanted to incorporate interactive elements to my designs (i.e. countdown and live bidding information) to encourage participation. </p>

                            <p>In June 2015, we kicked off our two week design sprint.  I organized the content in a way that groups similar items together, helping to move the eye throughout the page. I started to get feedback on wireframes. After several iterations and meetings, I created clickable prototypes and mockups. It was important to get feedback from the devs alongside the stakeholders to make sure that everything was feasible. </p>
                            <p>After the mockups were approved, we took a 6 month break from this project. In the meantime, I designed additional pages such as the onboarding sequence and how-to which explain the new platform. In addition, I created auth/unauth views, emails and graphics for auctions related marketing campaigns. </p>

                            <p>In December, I worked closely with development on the prototype. I recruited 7 users from varying backgrounds to evaluate the usability of the entire process: unauth, onboarding, bidding, and so on. After conducting usability tests, we determined some painpoints and made revisions to the designs. </p>
                            <p>Based on feedback, we reworked the "bidding bar" to keep all bidding and interactions in a consolidated area. In addition, we removed some duplicate components. Due to our new time constraint, we also removed filtering from the initial launch.

                            <p>After the company restructuring, the marketing team refreshed the visual design of our public facing website. Although the UI got a makeover, there were some UX issues that needed to be addressed. For this project, the product UX team collaborated with the marketing team. This project initially began as a proposal for a simplified navigation, but after our initial assessment and a successful pitch to c-level management, it turned into a complete overhaul of the existing website.</p> 
                            
                            <h4>Problem & Goals</h4> 
                            <p>There were too many levels in the navigation, the terminology was unclear and behavior was inconsistent. In order to better organize categories, consolidate and simplify the unnecessary hierarchy, we started gathering insights. We also discovered content needed munging.</p>

                            <h4>Process, Insights & Decisions</h4>
                            <p>To get the ball rolling, we needed a few questions answered: Who is this site for? What are we trying to accomplish with this site? How do we want to align our products to reach those people? How can we increase engagement with the new product pages? </p>
                            <p>We reviewed heat maps, analytics, survey and other feedback to understand customer habits and needs. Our initial assesment of heatmap analysis indicated strong interest in product content and distribution CTAs. Engagement faltered below the fold and bounce rates were high; content relied on marketecture diagrams to convey valuable information which left much of the content below the fold.</p>

                      <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12">
                          <p>Based on analytics, Download and Support were the most visited pages. We also knew bulk of the traffic came from social media marketing. The demographic was mostly made up of young men. Our competitive analysis also revealed that similar product marketing pages offered customer use cases, highlighting customer success, and particular applications of a product or solution.</p> 

                          <p>Our heuristic evaluation revealed some interesting facts as well. We had more content about the company than anything else; 9 of 28 pages were company-centric. Also, the prominent “Support” CTA directed users to paid support options, such as Enterprise Support, Consulting, and Training. Other support related content did not live in one place. Overall, the content lacked structure. </p>

                          <p>The goal was to dramatically simplify navigation and fix the current behavior (click vs hover dropdown, landing page per each category/subcategory). We also wanted to simplify the homepage and overall experience for two major personas: the distribution grabber (open source), and the buyer/upgrader (for our enterprise products). In order to achieve this, we wanted to highlight benefits, move content above the fold and consolidate similar or related information. We discovered there were links within our primary navigation, which were getting very little traffic. Our initial suggestion simplified existing navigation by removing unnecessary hierarchy and reducing the main categories from 10 to 4. </p>

                          <p>The feedback we received changed some of our perspectives. For example, it seemed though the company wanted to de-emphasize some current sections. Also, our primary personas increased to three groups: IT buyers, Data Scientists and Open Source users. We reached out to the sales teams to get a richer understanding of our customer profile. Based on this, we were able to create a list of major themes to be addressed by the information hierarchy of our content.</p>
                          <p>We explored designs which allowed visitors to self-identify and get what they need quickly, by orienting content based on who they are or what problem they are looking to solve. </p>

                          <p>My proposal aimed to address low engagement and high bounce rate. My designs feature a landing page which prominently featured content for all the personas. I also opted for smaller banners and replace marketecture with interactive, engaging and animated segments. </p>
                          <p>I chose the bolder brand color to convey trust, security and stability which are part of the major themes we discovered through sales customer profile. After several rounds of, feedback and iterations, we received the marketing team’s approval. Using the slider on the image below, you can see how much space can be saved by properly arranging content. </p>

Next steps include a UI review with the visual designer and roll out plan with development.</p>
